## What is IronmonConnect?
IronmonConnect brings the pokemon tracker to Twitch viewers so they can interact, look up and learn more about the streamer's run.<br>
Viewers can check out detailed information about your pokemon's **ability**, **moves**, see what **items** you have, and even check **pivots** before Brock and Safari Zone! <br><br>
